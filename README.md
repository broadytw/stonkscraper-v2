This was created by Danila Popel and Nikita Popel. This project was originally created on December 24th, 2020.
This project creates a terminal based stock market scraper that let's you check current stock prices and historical stock prices. This is v1.0 of the project and we intend to further elaborate on this design.
In v2.0, we implemented a GUI through using tkinter and matplotlib

Things to add in the future:
-Stock simulating game, allowing the user to invest fake money and cash in on fake dividends every quarter and reinvest their funds.
 could possibly be added as a functionality in the menu
-Add custom date range (user inputs a date in the past in order to display just that range in the graph window and show percentage change since then)
-Drop down arrow for recently visited stocks
