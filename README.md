###Description:
This project creates a terminal based stock market scraper that let's you check current stock prices and historical stock prices. This is v1.0 of the project and we intend to further elaborate on this design.
In v2.0, we implemented a GUI through using tkinter and matplotlib

Below is a list of goals that we would like to implement. If you have worked on any of them, get rid of them from the short-term goals and place then in the update log with your name and date

###Short-term Goals:
*N/A

###Long-term Goals:
*Add drop down arrow for recently visited stocks
*local storage for themes, save favorite stocks, step before stock sim implementation
*Stock simulating game, allowing the user to invest fake money and cash in on fake dividends every quarter and reinvest their funds.
**could possibly be added as a functionality in the menu
